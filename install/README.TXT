FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS

You should edit the "sockftpd.ini" file, in order to make
your desired settings.

A MySQL server is required to be installed somewhere in your network also.

After you've done configuring the ini file "sockftpd.exe", you should
install the program as a windows service, by using the "sockftpdctl.exe" program.

Run in a command line "sockftpdctl.exe" program, which is located in your
sockftpd folder, without any arguments, in order to see the list of arguments
this program supports.
